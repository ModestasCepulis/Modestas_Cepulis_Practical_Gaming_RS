 The whole idea of the game
 _____________________________________
 
 You are in control of a busy traffic movement in New York city.
 Your main goal is to avoid traffic and help all of the cars to reach their destination.
 You control the cars movement by clicking on them with your mouse (Mouse 1)
 
How do you earn points/score?
 _____________________________________
 You gain a point for every succesful car that managed to reach its destination
 (The destination is the outside area of the main camera)
 
 You gain points for every succesful bus stop, or every sucessful cross-walk
 
How do you lose/fail the game?
________________________________________
You fail the game if any collision happens.
For ex, if a car crashes into another car, if a car crashes into a bus, if a car crashes into a person, etc.
Once this happens, the game shows an UI that shows the current score, highscore and a replay button. 
 




Main Characters:

1. Cars/Vehicles
2. People(?)


Cars
-----------

# movement
===========

 -> Cars will be having 1 top speed that they cannot exceed
 -> Controls: Mouse 1 stops the car for few seconds.
 -> The car takes some time to slow down and stop and takes some time to regain its original speed (top speed)
 -> The cars might have lane switching.
 
 # collisions
 ==============
 
 -> Cars colliding with other cars
 -> Cars colliding with outside objects such as : people.
 

Outside objects that effect the gameplay
-----------

# traffic lights

 -> Stops the cars in a lane depending on the light
 -> Stops the people form walking on the sidewalks.
         - green means the cars can go and wont stop
         - orange/yellow does nothing
         - red stops all of the cars in the current lane

# people

 -> would walk on the sidewalks, cross the roads, get onto the bus.
   
# buses (?)

 -> buses would carry people and let them out at specific marked locations on the roads.
          - This would make the game harder to play as it would take few seconds 
            for the bus to move and etc.
 
 
 # bumps on the road
 
 -> bumps would stop/reduce the speed of the car/bus
 
 # cross - walks   
 
  -> people would use them to cross depending on the traffic light that it would have at the moment 
  
  # rain
  
  -> rain would dcerease the speed of the cars but increase the amount of time it takes for the car to break and start going again
  
  # night time/day time
  
  -> night time would decrease the speed of the cars but increase the amount of time it takes for the car to break and start going again.
  -> day time would increase the top speed of the cars but decrease the amount of time it takes for the car to break and start going again
