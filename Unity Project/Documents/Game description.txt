 The whole idea of the game
 _____________________________________
 
You are in control of a character that has a task of growing and regrowing plants and selling them to the 'town'.
Player 1: W A S D is used for movement, and V would be used to interact with the objects/tasks.
Player 2: I J K L is used for movement, and P would be used to interact with the objects/tasks.
The game would have a co-op function (An additional controllabe character)
 
How do you earn points/score?
 _____________________________________
You gain points for every succesful 'food' trip, or every succesful plant grown.
(There is going to be a wagon that takes away the fully grown plants)
 
 
How do you lose/fail the game?
________________________________________
You fail the game if you run out of seeds or you fail to supply any fully frown plants to the 'wagon'.
